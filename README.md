# Welcome to the UNO Party! (Frontend Edition) 🎉

Alright, so you're ready to build the coolest UNO game on the web? 💻  This is where the magic happens.  Think of this as your toolkit for creating awesome buttons, flashy cards  🃏, and that sweet victory screen 🏆.
## The Basics

This whole shindig was set up with something called Create React App. (It does some fancy behind-the-scenes stuff to make our lives easier 😉.)

## Let's Get This Show on the Road 🚀

Here's how to make this baby hum:

`npm start` :  Gets your development server up and running. Check it out at http://localhost:3000.  Any changes you make will update live like magic! ✨

`npm test` : Time to squash those pesky bugs! 🐛  This runs all your tests to make sure everything's working as it should.

`npm run build`: This one gets your game ready for the big leagues! 💪  It bundles everything up for a super speedy experience.

## Feeling Adventurous? 🗺️

If you're the type who likes to tinker under the hood, try running npm run eject.  Just remember, there's no going back once you do this!  It's your playground from then on.
